# Support and Maintenance

## Support Procedures

If there is a problem with the upload process, the client should open a ticket
and assign it to the [Ticket Queue] group. The ticket should contain the
keywords, "Client Name + Customization" in the description.

Support will be provided only between the hours of 8:00 AM to 4:30 PM Eastern
Time on business days, referred to here as the "Interface Support Hours."
Where the support program normally calls for [Company] support to take
certain steps within a specified time, only those hours within the Interface
Support Hours will be applicable.  For example if a request is received at 4:00
PM Eastern time on a Friday, or the evening before an [Company] Holiday,
the initiation will not occur until the morning of the next business day.

## Maintenance Procedures

In the event that a programming change is needed, the client will need to open a
new request.
